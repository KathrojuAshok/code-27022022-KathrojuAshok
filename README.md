Formatting json data



All the code for  calculating BMI,creating bmi category column and health risk column is in code.py, It will print the output as a JSON data and if the overweight persons are there
means it will give us "The total number of Overweight candidates are :{'Overweight': 2}" if there are no Overweight persons means it will give directly as "The total number of Overweight candidates are :0"




I have used unittest for testing of this code that is in test.py I have used 3 testcases.
